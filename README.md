# Improved Portfolio — Ashok

This bundle contains a modern, responsive, accessible template tuned for a developer portfolio.
Files:
- index.html — main page (update text/links & project details)
- styles.css — responsive styles with a subtle dark theme and rainbow headline
- script.js — small interactions (theme toggle, contact demo)
- assets/ — Ashok_CV.pdf , favicon, and images here

How to use:
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Edit `index.html` to update project descriptions, GitHub/LinkedIn links and my email.
3. Replace `assets/Ashok_CV.pdf` with my actual resume PDF (named exactly like that or update link).
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel by pushing to your repo and enabling GitHub Pages or connecting the repo.

Notes & prioritized fixes for your existing site:
1. Clarify your headline: make it consistent (Backend | Full‑Stack | Frontend).
2. Add 2–3 featured projects with results & links (live + repo).
3. Ensure your CV file name contains your name and is ATS-friendly.
4. Compress images and add `alt` text for accessibility.
5. Add meta tags for better SEO and social previews.

Happy to customize further — if you want, tell me which projects (titles + links + short bullet points) to include and I'll update the HTML accordingly.
